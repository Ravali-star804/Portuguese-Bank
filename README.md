Portuguese Bank Marketing Prediction
üìò Project Overview

This project analyzes the Portuguese Bank Marketing dataset to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit. The model uses customer and campaign-related data to identify patterns and assist banks in improving marketing strategies.

üß† Objective

To build a predictive model that helps the bank identify potential customers who are likely to subscribe to a term deposit.

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

üßÆ Steps in the Project

Import Libraries

Imported Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

Load the Dataset

Loaded the Portuguese Bank dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

Checked for missing values and basic data types.

Data Preprocessing

Handled missing or inconsistent data.

Encoded categorical features using Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding.

Scaled numerical variables for better model accuracy.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed customer demographics and campaign outcomes.

Visualized relationships using bar plots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps.

Model Building

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Trained models using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

Model Evaluation

Evaluated model performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score metrics.

Compared models to choose the best-performing one.

Prediction

Predicted whether a new customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on input data.

Conclusion

The predictive model helps banks target the right customers, improving marketing efficiency and reducing campaign costs.

üßæ Result

The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy, making it a reliable choice for predicting customer subscription likelihood.
